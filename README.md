# FastAPI Project with MySQL Connection
# Project Overview:
This repository contains a FastAPI project that connects to a MySQL database. The project is designed to provide a simple template for building web applications with FastAPI and interacting with a MySQL database.

# Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python (3.7+)
pip
MySQL Server
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/hmusman/fastapi-with-mysql
cd fastapi-mysql-project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Create a MySQL database and update the DATABASE_URL in database.py with your MySQL credentials and database name.

# Python
Copy code
DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/dbname"
Apply database migrations to create the necessary tables:

bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
Running the Application
Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
You can access the API at http://localhost:8000.

# API Endpoints
POST /items/: Create a new item.
GET /items/{item_id}: Retrieve an item by ID.
Usage Examples
You can use tools like curl, httpie, or any API client to interact with the API. For example:

# Create a new item:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Item 1", "description": "Description for Item 1"}' http://localhost:8000/items/
Retrieve an item by ID:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8000/items/1
